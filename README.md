# cointracker-utils
This is repo is a google chorme extension to add a few features to the current cointracker.io.

These changes have been made with no intention of harm, or financial benefits. 

The main goal in here is to have additional features available "in your computer" and "in your computer only".

I hope it's useful to you.

PS: This is covering only the Dashboard, the other pages have not been tested or worked on.
